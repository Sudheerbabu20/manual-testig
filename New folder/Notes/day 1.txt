2. uat testing 
means 
White - testing in the code of application.(only developers wil do this type of testing )
also called as closed box testing and its very time taken

Black box testing - testing the appilicaton no need to know about code of an application

1. Unit testing : unit is a white box testing . developers will do testing on the code we ARE DOING
                  unit is asingle component or module of an application.everyline of code need to execute once.

* Incremental integration testing
1. topdown approach
regi...login.. compose .. sent mail 
2. button up approach
sent ... compose ...login 
3. sandwich testing  
 bothe topdown and button up (everyting is perfect no bugs then we will move to system testing)

 * non incremental integration testing : Full application testing	

3 System testing : testerer will do the testing
   *GUI testing---
                  will test on the web applilications 

   *Functional testing
   *Non functional testing
   *Usability testing 
4.UAT -- User acceptance testing
  before sending to the customer what ever testing is done is called as UAT testing
