testing terminologies 
1. retesting 
       bug resolution (re testing the same feautre untill the the test was passed)
2. Regression testing -
 	we are testing feature which are found bug and also the dependent modules 
ex of reg
studentr marks- e 20, m,20, s 20-- total mark 60 
if we change the enlish marks it effects total marks

sales ----accounts --- profit 
3.positive and negative  testing -

    only alphabets not spaces :
   			positive: abdebdbe dbedekenje
			negative: special char , numbers....
4. end to end testing :
 		starting to ending of appilication at a time we can teest
		login-- check balance-- sent amount-- verifyy otp- logout.
5. smoke testing: basic and first testing 
		checking build or appication is opening or not  
		if testing is failed we will say to developers that the build is failed 
		if testing is a=passed we start with functional testiing
		This test can be done bye bothe developers and testers
6.sanity testing:
		stable build we will test 
		we will test not in deep to all the modules are working fine or not
		only tester	s will test 
7. exploratory testing:
 		application is there but FRS or testcases are not.we need to create testcases with help of application as the tester 
		should know some prior knowledge about this application.
		This type mainly freshers to a company

8. monkey/gorilla testing:
		next step we cant identify for testing
        	ex: mainly for gaming , candy crush game
9.adhoc testing:
		we dont have previous knowledge of an application ,we dont have frs,we dont have test cases


100% bug resolution cant be done  
all testing terms done
