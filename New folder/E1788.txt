1.explain about different levels of testing 15marks
Ans)
testing are of two types manual testing and automation testing
and in manual testing we have 
white box , black box, gray box 
		1) unit testing 2) integration testing 3) system testing 4 ) UAT(user accepatance testing)
unit testing and integration testing are comes under white box testing
system testing and Uat testing comes under black box testing
  1 unit testing : developers will perform this type of testing, code of the application must be required to test the application
  2 integration testing : no  need of understanding the code of the application this will be performed by the testers
                         incremantal integration testing is of 3 types
			 top down approach : here we will test the applicaition from registarion to logout
			 bottom up approach : here we will test the application from logout to registarion
			 sandwhich testing : the combination of both top down and bottom up is called sandwhich testing

  3 system testing : i system testing we have 
			GUI testing : will test on web applications , 
			functional testing : 1 object propertybehavior of an element( text box, button, dropdown,upload buttons)
   					     2 Data base testing    3 Link existance and links execution   4 Calculation and manipulation and Globalisation and localisation testing  	
		        non functional testing :
   					 performance testsing- at a same time if a sum no of clients opened the applicaition it should run smoothly
					 stress testing
					 installation /uninstallation testing 
   					 security testing
					 Sanitation or garbage testing
    					 configurations testing
			usability testing
     					 
  					  
  4 Uat testing  : is of two types alpha testing and beta testing 
		alpha testing : which will be done test environment
		beta testing : test is done by the customer


2.create a students table
   Insert 5 student details with name,marks of 3 subjects and roll number (5marks)

ANS:
   Create Database college
   create Table student
	(
		rollnumber int,
		Name VARCHAR(32),
		Englishmarks int,
		socialmarks int,
		Telugumarks int,
	 	Hindhimarks int
		) ;
after that inserting the values
		insert into student values(1,'ram',80,90,100)
		insert into student values(2,'shyam',90,70,50)
		insert into student values(3,'bhuvan',58,56,56)
		insert into student values(4,'bhanu',45,56,67)
		insert into student values(5,'rani',55,57,89)

3.what is retesting ,regressionteston,smoke and sanity testing 5 marks
ANS:
1. retesting testing : 
while Retesting is done only for failed test cases.
if a bug is raised for a particular for exaple  login page then we test the login module again until the test was passed  which is also called as bug resolution
example login failed then we will do the retesting for the login fucnctionality
2. Regression testing : Regression testing is performed for passed test cases
 	we are testing feature which are found bug and also the dependent modules 


4.what is joins explain different types of jojns with examples 5 marks
ans:
Joins are of 5 types
   1)natural join : joining two tables with no condtions which is also a type of select
      command to exicute the natural join 
		select * from table1
		natural join tabel2
   2)left join : which is also called as left outer join , if we consider two tables a and b if we use this left join it will select all the data from the table a and will show the results which are in common with table a and the uncommon part will be null
		Select * from table1 
		left join tabel2
		on tabel.coulmnname=table.columnname
   3) right join: which is also called as right outer join , if we consider two tables a and b if we use this right join it will select all the data from the table b and will show the results which are in common with table b and the uncommon part will be null
		Select * from table1 
		left join tabel2
		on tabel.coulmnname=table.columnname
   4) inner join: intersection of two tables 
		Select * from table1 
		Inner join tabel2
		on tabel.coulmnname=table.columnname
   5) Full join : the comnination of two tables all the data will be combined the same data will show you the results and a the unccommon data will show as null
		Select * from table1 
		left join tabel2
		on tabel.coulmnname=table.columnname
		union
 		Select * from table1 
		right join tabel2
		on tabel.coulmnname=table.columnname 

5.what is ECP and BVA with examples  10marks

ans:
 
ecp :or equivalence class partitioning , when  the range between the two number are high we use ecp
equally we need to classify 
Equivalence partitioning or equivalence class partitioning (ECP) is a software testing 
technique that divides the input data of a software unit  into partitions of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived
, when  the range between the two number are high we use ecp
	for example 1000- 2000
		if we check a random number from 0-500 like 499 it is a invalid number which is also called as negative testing
		if we check a random number from 500- 1000 like 501 it is a invalid number whic is also called as negative testing
		if we check a random number from  1000-2000 like 1001 it is a valid number which is also called as  positive testing
	 	if we check a random number from 2000--3000 like 3001 it is a invalid number which is also called as negative testing
	
BVA which is called as (boundary value analysyis),BVA is another Black Box Test Design Technique, 
which is used to find the errors at boundaries of input domain (tests the behavior of a program at the input boundaries) 
rather than finding those errors in the centre of input.
 when the range between the two number are low we use bva
	for example 100 to 6130 for that boundary values are 99 ,101 and 129, 131
		positive : 101, 129
		negative :101, 131


6.write positive and negative values for searching a product in amazon 5marks

positive: tshirts, books,pens,mobiles , tvs, electronics,
negative: 1234565, @@@@@@, while we check for pen it shows book, 

7.what is select in SQL..how we can  use different selects with examples a

select can be used for a paritcular portion to be selected or else whole table to be selected  
we use select in joins for example in inner join 
examples : in a table we have english marks, maths marks , cince marks by using the select command in a large data base we can see the data if the english marks by using the select comand
syntax
  select* from table;
